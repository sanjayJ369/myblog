A webhook is an HTTP POST request that is made when a change or event happens in a system. For example, this could occur when the system starts, stops, or when certain conditions are met. This HTTP POST request contains information regarding the change, which programmers can use to initiate actions.
Consider GitHub as an example. When a push event occurs (which is a webhook event), GitHub sends a POST request to the payload URL.</description>
