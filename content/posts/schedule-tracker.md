# Schedule Tracker

The main purpose of this project is to digitize the progress tracking I currently do with the help of my diary. Why did I choose this project? Itâ€™s fairly simple, and I havenâ€™t built an end-to-end application before (other than the webhook tester). This project will include features like user accounts, logins, authentication, and more.

Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of what I want to achieve:

### **Sessions Tracking**

I usually track my daily progress using sessions. While itâ€™s not a perfect measure of the work done, I think itâ€™s a fairly good indicator.

I break tasks into 45-minute chunks, calling each chunk a _session_ (you could adjust this to 1 hour, 1.5 hours, etc.). For smaller tasks, I use 30-minute chunks and call them _mini-sessions_ ðŸ˜….

Hereâ€™s what I want to track:

- **Number of sessions**
- **Gaps between sessions**

Currently, I track my sessions and daily session counts manually. With the data collected, I want to generate graphs and analytics.

### **Miscellaneous Goals**

In addition to tracking sessions, I also want to track specific goals like meditation, gym workouts, etc. Users will be able to define multiple goals and keep track of progress for each one.

I plan to create a system similar to GitHubâ€™s contribution graph, where reaching more goals results in more green squares.

### **Next Steps**

This was a high-level overview of the project. The next step is to create an event modeling diagram to better understand the systems involved, the tasks required, and the goals to achieve.
